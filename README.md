# CodeClause_Churn_Prediction_in_Telecom_Industry

This project is an analysis of customer churn in the telecom industry using logistic regression. The dataset used contains information about customer demographics, services subscribed, and monthly charges. The features include customer ID, tenure, phone service, contract type, payment method, paperless billing, gender, senior citizenship, partnership status, dependents, multiple lines, internet service, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, streaming TV, streaming movies, and churn. 

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict which customers are likely to churn and identify the key factors that influence their decision. To achieve this, we preprocessed the data, performed exploratory data analysis, and built a logistic regression model. We also balanced the data to address class imbalance and evaluated the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score.

By analyzing the results, we gain insights into the factors that drive customer churn and can use this information to design targeted retention strategies. This project can be useful to telecom companies looking to reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.
